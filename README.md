# Advent of Code 2023

This my repo for the Advent of Code 2023

You can find more information of that challenge here: [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).

## Challenge

My personal challenge for this advent of code is to write it in node js using, when possible, no packages.

I will also code using a test driven development (TDD) approach and try to get 100% code coverage.

### !!! Update !!!
As of Day 3, I decided that I prefered going back to C#. I will still be using a TDD approach.
